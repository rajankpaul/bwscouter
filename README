# BWScouter

BWScouter (short for BedWars Scouter) is a Python script that allows you to retrieve various statistics for a player in Hypixel's popular game mode, BedWars. With BWScouter, you can easily view a player's Bedwars experience, Bedwars stars, win/loss ratio, final kill/death ratio, and more.

## Features

- Retrieve Bedwars statistics for any player in Hypixel's Bedwars game mode
- Calculate Bedwars stars for a player based on their Bedwars experience
- View win/loss ratio and final kill/death ratio for a player

## Future Plans

We plan to add the following features to BWScouter in the future:

- Support for other game modes in Hypixel, such as SkyWars and Mega Walls
- Integration with Discord, allowing users to easily retrieve Bedwars statistics for any player in their Discord server
- Ability to view historical data for a player, including changes in their Bedwars stats over time

## How to Use

To use BWScouter, simply run the Python script and enter the name of the player you want to view statistics for. If the player is found, BWScouter will display their Bedwars stats, including their Bedwars experience, Bedwars stars, win/loss ratio, final kill/death ratio, and more. You can also enter the command `/top1` to view the top player on the Bedwars leaderboard, or `/top10` to view the top 10 players.
